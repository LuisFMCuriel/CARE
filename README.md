Machine learning CARE

Change from notebook 3D to 2D, the training dataset was 500 images of the first 5 stack images. The error plots were added to the notebook. In the prediction for each image you will get the error.
The last version has a wrong model. The model is not autosaved on the exact drive folder you specify.
Did not get the same results than the last notebook, even though was configured with the same hyperparameters. Probably because of the patches generation.
